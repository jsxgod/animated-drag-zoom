# Skate shop

A mobile only ecommerce shop brought to life with React.</br>
Built upon a singular idea - fun deck exploring while making a purchase.
####
The goal for the shop was to have an unique skateboard deck viewing user experience. Clients can drag to enlarge the decks to break the established visual boundaries of the page. Grew into a full-stack ecommerce project.
